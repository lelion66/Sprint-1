User Stories:
#1: As a student user, I want to be able to filter outfit options based on different criteria such as price, climate, color, and gender, so that I can quickly find outfits that match my needs and preferences.
#2: As a first-time user, I want to be able to easily create an account and navigate the platform, so that I can quickly start finding outfit inspiration and ideas.
#3: As a user who is searching for a specific type of outfit, I want to be able to save my favorite outfits to my profile or create a personalized logbook, so that I can easily refer back to them later and keep track of my favorite outfit options.
